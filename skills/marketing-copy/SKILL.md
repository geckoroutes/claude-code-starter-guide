# Marketing Copy

Apply these frameworks when writing landing pages, CTAs, email copy, product descriptions, or any user-facing marketing content.

## Copywriting Frameworks

### PAS (Problem → Agitate → Solution)
1. **Problem**: Name the pain the reader feels
2. **Agitate**: Make it worse — show consequences of not solving it
3. **Solution**: Present your product as the relief

Best for: Landing page heroes, email sequences, ad copy.

### AIDA (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action)
1. **Attention**: Bold headline or surprising stat
2. **Interest**: "Here's why this matters to you"
3. **Desire**: Benefits, social proof, transformation
4. **Action**: Clear CTA

Best for: Sales pages, long-form landing pages.

### BAB (Before → After → Bridge)
1. **Before**: Current painful state
2. **After**: Dream outcome
3. **Bridge**: Your product connects the two

Best for: Short copy, email subject lines, social posts.

### 4U Headline Formula
- **Useful**: What's in it for the reader?
- **Urgent**: Why now?
- **Ultra-specific**: Numbers, details, concrete outcomes
- **Unique**: What makes this different?

## Landing Page Structure

### Hero Section
- **Headline**: One clear value proposition (max 10 words)
- **Subheadline**: How it works or who it's for (max 25 words)
- **CTA**: One primary button (action-oriented: "Start Free", "Get Started", "Try It Free")
- **Social proof**: "Used by 500+ teams" or logos or star rating
- **Visual**: Product screenshot or illustration (not stock photo)

### Problem Section
- Name 3 specific pain points the target audience has
- Use their language (not your jargon)

### Solution/Features Section
- 3-4 features max
- Each feature: benefit headline + 1-sentence explanation + icon/visual
- Lead with benefit, not feature name ("Save 4 hours/week" not "Automated Reports")

### Social Proof Section
- Testimonials with name + photo + company (real people)
- Specific results ("Increased conversions by 34%")
- Logos of known companies if applicable

### Pricing Section
- 3 tiers maximum
- Highlight recommended plan
- Annual toggle saves X% (anchor to monthly price)
- Feature comparison table for complex products

### CTA Section (bottom)
- Repeat the primary CTA
- Address final objection ("No credit card required", "Cancel anytime")

## SEO Fundamentals

### On-Page
- **Title tag**: Primary keyword + benefit, under 60 characters
- **Meta description**: What the page offers + CTA, under 155 characters
- **H1**: One per page, includes primary keyword
- **URL**: Short, descriptive, hyphenated (`/pricing` not `/pricing-plans-for-teams-2024`)
- **Alt text**: Describe the image, include keyword if natural
- **Internal links**: Link to related pages with descriptive anchor text

### Content
- **Keyword intent**: Match the page type to search intent (informational → blog, transactional → landing page)
- **Answer the question**: First paragraph should directly answer what the searcher wants
- **Headers**: Use H2/H3 for scannable structure
- **Length**: Match competitors (check top 3 results for target keyword)

### Technical
- **Page speed**: Under 3s load time (compress images, lazy load below fold)
- **Mobile-friendly**: Responsive, readable without zoom
- **HTTPS**: Required
- **Sitemap**: XML sitemap at `/sitemap.xml`
- **Robots.txt**: Don't accidentally block important pages

## Conversion Optimization

### Principles
- **One goal per page**: Don't split attention between multiple CTAs
- **Reduce friction**: Fewer form fields, social login, progress indicators
- **Build trust**: Security badges, money-back guarantee, testimonials
- **Create urgency**: Limited spots, countdown timers, "last updated" dates (only if genuine)

### CTA Button Copy
Good: "Start Free Trial", "Get My Report", "Join 500+ Users"
Bad: "Submit", "Click Here", "Learn More"

### Form Optimization
- Ask only what's needed (name + email for signups, not phone/company/role)
- Inline validation (show errors as they type)
- Autofocus first field
- Show what happens after submission

## Email Copy

### Subject Lines
- Under 50 characters
- Personal ("Your", "You")
- Specific ("3 ways to..." not "Tips for...")
- Avoid spam triggers (ALL CAPS, excessive !!!, "free money")

### Body
- First line: hook (not "Hi, I'm writing to...")
- One idea per email
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- One CTA (not three)
- PS line for secondary message (high readership)

## Voice & Tone

Default to clear, confident, and conversational unless the project's style guide says otherwise:
- Active voice ("We built" not "It was built")
- Second person ("You'll save" not "Users save")
- Concrete ("Save 4 hours/week" not "Increase efficiency")
- Short sentences (under 20 words average)
- No jargon unless the audience expects it
